# MLF: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) Implementation for MNIST Digit Recognition Project

This project is done as team project for **CSC-722: Machine Learning Fundamentals** class.

The goal of this project is to build and evaluate a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for recognizing handwritten digits from the MNIST Dataset. 

This project utilizes the MNIST dataset, a classic benchmark dataset for handwritten digit recognition, which is hosted in the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/) at the following link.
